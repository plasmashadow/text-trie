  Whenever Iâ€™m feeling uninspired I
  look to a collection of my favorite literary quotes
  I keep in a document on my computer Today was one of those days
  As I was re-reading some of these and remembering why I love writing
  reading and the power of words and a good story I thought perhaps
  someone somewhere out there might be feeling the same as me this morning
  Here are 31 of the most beautiful passages in literature
